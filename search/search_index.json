The project consists of Python APIs used to create a Python client application and C++ servers that communicate with the Python client over a serial or WiFi link. The project offers two server libraries to control and monitor a Single Board Computer (SBC). Telemetrix4Arduino uses a serial USB link, supporting Arduino and STM32 development boards, and the other, Telemetrix4ESP8266 , uses a WiFi link in support of the ESP-8266. Both servers are written using standard Arduino C++ and may be installed via the Arduino IDE library manager. Once installed, no further changes to the SBC code are necessary. Also included are two client APIs, telemetrix , which uses standard Python threading techniques for concurrency, and telemetrix-aio for those who prefer to work within a Python asyncio environment. Both clients support serial and WiFi communications and may be used with either server. Here is a feature comparison between Telemetrix and StandardFirmata: Feature Telemetrix StandardFirmata Analog Input X X Analog Output (PWM) X X Digital Input X X Digital Output X X i2c Primitives X X Servo Motor Control X X DHT Temperature/Humidity Sensor X OneWire Primitives X HC-SR04 Sonar Distance Sensor X SPI Primitives X Stepper Motor Control (AccelStepper) X Python Threaded Client Included X Python Asyncio Client Included X Support For STM32 Boards (Black Pill) X Designed To Be User Extensible X Integrated Debugging Aids Provided X Examples For All Features X Summary Of Major Features Applications are programmed using conventional Python 3.

But, what if you want to add support for something outside of the base set? Telemetrix was designed specifically to allow you to extend its capabilities to customize it to meet your needs. Before going into a little detail about the infrastructure let's look at how the client and server exchange information. Understanding Telemetrix Data Packets When an application wishes to control the server or when the server wishes to report data information back to the application, a Telemetrix Data Packet is formed and sent over the serial or WiFi link For consistency, the format for both client and server packets is identical. Let's take a look at the packet format. Packet Format A Telemetrix Packet consists of 3 parts. The packet length, the packet ID and the payload. Packet ID The packet ID contains either a command or report ID. These IDs are defined to be the same value for both client and server. This is shown in the examples below. On the client side, command IDs are declared in private_constants.py . When creating a command packet the command method selects the appropriate command packed ID to use. # commands # send a loop back request - for debugging communications LOOP_COMMAND = 0 SET_PIN_MODE = 1 # set a pin to INPUT/OUTPUT/PWM/etc DIGITAL_WRITE = 2 # set a single digital pin value instead of entire port ANALOG_WRITE = 3 On the server side, the IDs are declared in the .ino file. // Commands -received by this sketch // Add commands retaining the sequential numbering. // The order of commands here must be maintained in the command_table. #define SERIAL_LOOP_BACK 0 #define SET_PIN_MODE 1 #define DIGITAL_WRITE 2 #define ANALOG_WRITE 3 The server uses the command packet ID to index into an array of function pointers used to implement the command. This array is called the command table. command_descriptor command_table[] = { {&serial_loopback}, {&set_pin_mode}, {&digital_write}, {&analog_write}, When adding a new command Here is a partial list of command IDs. Packet Length The payload length and packet ID portions of the packet are each one byte in length. The total payload length is of variable size and is reflected in the payload length byte. A High Level View Of Adding An Extension Commands Reports Create A New Command To command the server to perform ommands are implemented through calls to the API Telemetrix is driven by the client and server exchanging data packets. To add new features, one must understand the structure and use of these packets. The data packets originating from the client are called command packets. The data packets originating from the server are called reporter packets. The format for both command and reporter packets is the same. Packet ID The packet ID is used by both the client and server to locate the When Telemetrix4Arduino receives a command in the get_next_command function, all of the bytes that follow the packet ID are placed into a command_buffer for processing. The ESP-8266 server behaves in the same manner. When a Telemetrix client receives a report, the _reporter method also places all of the bytes following the packet ID into the response_data buffer for processing. The Packet ID The packet ID identifies the command or report type. The packet ID drives the data processing of the system. Building And Sending A Command Packet To associate a GPIO digital input pin with a DHT device, the client application calls the set_pin_mode_dht method. The set_pin_mode_dht method creates a list containing command packet values of the command ID, the GPIO pin-number and the DHT device type. command = [PrivateConstants.DHT_NEW, pin, dht_type] self._send_command(command) The set_pin_mode_dht method then calls the _ send_command utility method. The length of the command packet is calculated and placed as the first byte of the command. The command is then converted to a byte string and sent across the link. def _send_command(self, command): \"\"\" This is a private utility method. :param command: command data in the form of a list \"\"\" # the length of the list is added at the head command.insert(0, len(command)) send_message = bytes(command) if self.serial_port: try: self.serial_port.write(send_message) except SerialException: if self.shutdown_on_exception: self.shutdown() raise RuntimeError('write fail in _send_command') elif self.ip_address: self.sock.sendall(send_message) else: raise RuntimeError('No serial port or ip address set.') The command variable is list populated with the command ID, DHT_NEW, the GPIO pin number, and a dht_type. For commands, the server maintains an array of command handler function pointers. The packet ID is used as an index into the array to retrieve its associated command handler function. For reports, the client maintains a dictionary of report handler methods. The packet ID is the key used to retrieve the associated report handling method. Preparing For The New Extension Before jumping directly into coding, you should consider a few things when designing your extension. Review the library's API to select the methods you wish to support. You may support the complete set of library functions or a subset. For this example, only the minimum functions will be supported to help keep things as simple as possible. The library chosen for the DHT is the DHTstable library . Determine if there is a time constraint on accessing the device. The DHT 22, for example, can only be read every 2 seconds to receive valid data. We will demonstrate how to support this restriction in a non-blocking manner. Determine the number of instances of the device you wish to support. For the DHT 22, up to six devices are supported. Implementing The New Extension Design Decisions For the DHT, a new command method, called set_pin_mode_dht , is added to the client, and an associated command handler is created on the server. A new report is added for the server to notify the client of the latest humidity and temperature values retrieved from the DHT device. An associated report handler is added to the client. The DHT feature is implemented on the server using the following DHTStable methods: read11 read22 getHumidity getTemperature Note that this is only a subset of available methods provided by DHTStable. Adding A New Command Client Side First, add a new command ID to private_constants.py. # commands # send a loop back request - for debugging communications LOOP_COMMAND = 0 SET_PIN_MODE = 1 # set a pin to INPUT/OUTPUT/PWM/etc DIGITAL_WRITE = 2 # set a single digital pin value instead of entire port ANALOG_WRITE = 3 MODIFY_REPORTING = 4 GET_FIRMWARE_VERSION = 5 ARE_U_THERE = 6 # Arduino ID query for auto-detect of telemetrix connected boards SERVO_ATTACH = 7 SERVO_WRITE = 8 SERVO_DETACH = 9 I2C_BEGIN = 10 I2C_READ = 11 I2C_WRITE = 12 SONAR_NEW = 13 DHT_NEW = 14 DHT_NEW is the command that will be sent to the server. Server Side Adding A New Report Server Side Client Side Four Steps To Add The New Command And Its Report 1. Modify The Client For DHT support, we are going to add a set_pin_mode_dht command. This command will instruct the server add a DHT to its list of DHT devices that it needs to monitor. On the client side, this is the only new method we need to add. On the server side, we will need to add code to accept the new command. The server also needs code to build a report message when it monitors the DHT devices. The assumption is that the new extension will ultimately result in continuous report generation without any additional API calls. Your device may have different requirements, and you will need to adjust things for your particular case. Modifying The Client For The New Command For DHT support, a single command will be added to associate a GPIO pin with a sensor. To be consistent, we will call this command set_pin_mode_dht . 1. Add A Constant Value For The New Command Edit the private_constants.py file and add a value for the new command. Below are the steps used for adding the DHT extension. We will use the telemetrix client for illustration purposes. Modifying telemetrix-aio would take a similar approach. The following sections discuss each step in detail. Add a new client command to be transmitted to the server. Add a new command handler on the server to process the command. Add a new function to the server to continuously monitor the device and generate data reports. Add a new function to the client to handle the new incoming reports. Adding A New Client Command 1. Define A New Command Value To add a new command to the API, define a new command value in private_constants.py . class PrivateConstants: \"\"\" This class contains a set of constants for telemetrix internal use . \"\"\" # commands # send a loop back request - for debugging communications LOOP_COMMAND = 0 SET_PIN_MODE = 1 # set a pin to INPUT/OUTPUT/PWM/etc DIGITAL_WRITE = 2 # set a single digital pin value instead of entire port ANALOG_WRITE = 3 MODIFY_REPORTING = 4 GET_FIRMWARE_VERSION = 5 ARE_U_THERE = 6 # Arduino ID query for auto-detect of telemetrix connected boards SERVO_ATTACH = 7 SERVO_WRITE = 8 SERVO_DETACH = 9 I2C_BEGIN = 10 I2C_READ = 11 I2C_WRITE = 12 SONAR_NEW = 13 DHT_NEW = 14 #<-----------New Command For the DHT!!!!!!!!!!!!! STOP_ALL_REPORTS = 15 SET_ANALOG_SCANNING_INTERVAL = 16 Here the command DHT_NEW was added. 2. Define the maximum number of DHT devices to be supported. Add this value to private_contants.py # Maximum number of dht devices allowed MAX_DHTS = 6 3. Add storage to telemetrix.py to keep track of the number of currently active DHT devices and their associated callback functions. self.dht_callbacks = {} self.dht_count = 0 The dht_callbacks dictionary uses the pin number for the DHT device as a key to retrieve its associated callback function. The dht_count variable keeps track of the number of currently active DHT devices. 4. Add a command method to telemetrix.py to command the server to add a new DHT device. def set_pin_mode_dht(self, pin, callback=None): \"\"\" :param pin: connection pin :param callback: callback function Error Callback: [Callback 0=DHT REPORT, DHT_ERROR=0, PIN, Error Number, Time] Valid Data Callback: Callback 0=DHT REPORT, DHT_DATA=1, PIN, Humidity, Temperature Time] \"\"\" if not callback: if self.shutdown_on_exception: self.shutdown() raise RuntimeError('set_pin_mode_dht: A Callback must be specified') if self.dht_count < PrivateConstants.MAX_DHTS - 1: self.dht_callbacks[pin] = callback self.dht_count += 1 command = [PrivateConstants.DHT_NEW, pin] self._send_command(command) else: if self.shutdown_on_exception: self.shutdown() raise RuntimeError(f'Maximum Number Of DHTs Exceeded - set_pin_mode_dht fails for pin {pin}') The name set_pin_mode_dht, was chosen to stay consistent with the telemetrix naming conventions. Because DHT devices generate reports, we ensure that the user specifies a callback function for the device. The callback is added to dht_callbacks, and the number of active DHT devices is incremented. If the maximum number of DHT devices is exceeded, a RuntimeError is raised. Otherwise, a command data packet is built and sent to the server. NOTE: The _send_command method will automatically calculate the payload length and append it to the packet. Modifying The Server Adding A New Server Command Handler 1. Add the library to the list of #includes #include <Arduino.h> #include \"Telemetrix4Arduino.h\" #include <Servo.h> #include <Ultrasonic.h> #include <Wire.h> #include <dhtnew.h> // Adding dhtnew 2. Create A Name For The New Command Handler Function And Declare It As Extern // Create forward references for all the command handlers. // If you add a new command, you must add the command handler // here as well. extern void serial_loopback(); extern void set_pin_mode(); extern void digital_write(); extern void analog_write(); extern void modify_reporting(); extern void get_firmware_version(); extern void are_you_there(); extern void servo_attach(); extern void servo_write(); extern void servo_detach(); extern void i2c_begin(); extern void i2c_read(); extern void i2c_write(); extern void sonar_new(); extern void dht_new(); // The New Command Handler extern void stop_all_reports(); extern void set_analog_scanning_interval(); 3. Define A Value For The Command That Matches The Value Defined In The Client // Commands -received by this sketch // Add commands retaining the sequential numbering. // The order of commands here must be maintained in the command_table. #define SERIAL_LOOP_BACK 0 #define SET_PIN_MODE 1 #define DIGITAL_WRITE 2 #define ANALOG_WRITE 3 #define MODIFY_REPORTING 4 // mode(all, analog, or digital), pin, enable or disable #define GET_FIRMWARE_VERSION 5 #define ARE_U_THERE 6 #define SERVO_ATTACH 7 #define SERVO_WRITE 8 #define SERVO_DETACH 9 #define I2C_BEGIN 10 #define I2C_READ 11 #define I2C_WRITE 12 #define SONAR_NEW 13 #define DHT_NEW 14 // The Command value #define STOP_ALL_REPORTS 15 #define SET_ANALOG_SCANNING_INTERVAL 16 4. Update The Command Table With The New Command The data structures are provided below. To update the table, increase the size of the command_table to accept the new command.

If the read returns a zero, then there are no issues and nothing to report. However, a non-zero value is an error indicator. The error value is returned as a report. Add A New Server Function To Continuously Monitor The Device 1. Create A Device Scanner Function For Active DHT Devices We are going to create the scan_dhts scanning function and then call the function in the loop section of the sketch. The scan_dhts function prebuilds a report_message buffer assuming that the read will return valid data. The format for the report is shown in the comments for the function. For valid data, the floating-point values are copied to the buffer as bytes, and a report is sent across the link. If an error is returned as a result of the read, byte 2 of the report, the report sub-type is changed from DHT_DATA to DHT_ERROR, and the payload length is changed to a value of 4 bytes. The report is then sent across the serial link. void scan_dhts() { // prebuild report for valid data // reuse the report if a read command fails // data returned is in floating-point form - 4 bytes // each for humidity and temperature // byte 0 = packet length // byte 1 = report type // byte 2 = report sub type - DHT_DATA or DHT_ERROR // btye 3 = pin number // byte 4 = humidity high order byte for data or error value // byte 5 = humidity byte 2 // byte 6 = humidity byte 3 // byte 7 = humidity byte 4 // byte 8 = temperature high order byte for data or // byte 9 = temperature byte 2 // byte 10 = temperature byte 3 // byte 11 = temperature byte 4 byte report_message[12] = {11, DHT_REPORT, DHT_DATA, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}; byte d_read; float dht_data; // are there any dhts to read? if (dht_index) { // is it time to do the read? This should occur every 2 seconds dht_current_millis = millis(); if (dht_current_millis - dht_previous_millis > dht_scan_interval) { // update for the next scan dht_previous_millis += dht_scan_interval; // read and report all the dht sensors for (int i = 0; i < dht_index; i++) { report_message[3] = dhts[i].pin; // get humidity dht_data = dhts[i].dht_sensor->getHumidity(); memcpy(&report_message[4], &dht_data, sizeof dht_data); // get temperature dht_data = dhts[i].dht_sensor->getTemperature(); memcpy(&report_message[8], &dht_data, sizeof dht_data); Serial.write(report_message, 12); // now read do a read for this device for next go around d_read = dhts[i].dht_sensor->read(); if (d_read) { // error found // send report //send_debug_info(1, 1); report_message[0] = 4; report_message[1] = DHT_REPORT; report_message[2] = DHT_READ_ERROR; report_message[3] = dhts[i].pin; // pin number report_message[4] = d_read; Serial.write(report_message, 5); } } } } } 2. Scan The Active DHT Sensors In The Sketch Loop Function void loop() { // keep processing incoming commands get_next_command(); if(! stop_reports){ // stop reporting scan_digital_inputs(); scan_analog_inputs(); scan_sonars(); scan_dhts(); scan the active DHT sensors. } } Add a New Client Report Handler 1. Add An Entry For The DHT Report To The Report Dispatch Dictionary The report_dispatch dictionary uses report ID values as a key to look up the handler for the incoming report. The dictionary update method is used when adding a new entry into the dispatch dictionary. # The report_dispatch dictionary is used to process # incoming report messages by looking up the report message # and executing its associated processing method. self.report_dispatch = {} # To add a command to the command dispatch table, append here. self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.LOOP_COMMAND: self._report_loop_data}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.DEBUG_PRINT: self._report_debug_data}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.DIGITAL_REPORT: self._digital_message}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.ANALOG_REPORT: self._analog_message}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.FIRMWARE_REPORT: self._firmware_message}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.I_AM_HERE_REPORT: self._i_am_here}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.SERVO_UNAVAILABLE: self._servo_unavailable}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.I2C_READ_REPORT: self._i2c_read_report}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.I2C_TOO_FEW_BYTES_RCVD: self._i2c_too_few}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.I2C_TOO_MANY_BYTES_RCVD: self._i2c_too_many}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.SONAR_DISTANCE: self._sonar_distance_report}) self.report_dispatch.update({PrivateConstants.DHT_REPORT: self._dht_report}) 2. Create The Report Handler This function builds a report, and looks up the callback function for the DHT device using the reported pin number as the key and calls the callback function. def _dht_report(self, data): \"\"\" This is the dht report handler method. :param data: data[0] = report sub type - DHT_DATA or DHT_ERROR data[1] = pin number data[2] = humidity high order byte or error value if DHT_ERROR data[3] = humidity byte 2 data[4] = humidity byte 3 data[5] = humidity byte 4 data[6] = temperature high order byte for data data[7] = temperature byte 2 data[8] = temperature byte 3 data[9] = temperature byte 4 \"\"\" if data[0]: # DHT_ERROR # error report # data[0] = report sub type, data[1] = pin, data[2] = error message if self.dht_callbacks[data[1]]: # Callback 0=DHT REPORT, DHT_ERROR=0, PIN, Error Number, Time message = [PrivateConstants.DHT_REPORT, data[0], data[1], data[2], time.time()] self.dht_callbacks[data[1]](message) else: # got valid data DHT_DATA f_humidity = bytearray(data[2:6]) f_temperature = bytearray(data[6:]) message = [PrivateConstants.DHT_REPORT, data[0], data[1], (struct.unpack('<f', f_humidity))[0], (struct.unpack('<f', f_temperature))[0], time.time()] self.dht_callbacks[data[1]](message) Coping With Various Data Types With A Byte-Oriented Serial Link When data is sent across the serial link, it is sent as a series of bytes. Some data types, such as integers and floating-point values, are larger than a single byte. For the Telemetrix Project, an integer value is two bytes in length, and a floating-point value is four bytes in size. The multi-byte values are disassembled into individual bytes before transmission when sending a value larger than a byte in length. When received, the individual bytes are reassembled into the original multi-byte value. For all data items that must be represented in this manner, by convention, the most significant byte (MSB) is the first byte transmitted, followed by all subsequent bytes in descending byte order. For example, the DHT 22 sensor expresses temperature and humidity values as floating-point. To send a report containing these values to the client, they must first be converted to individual bytes. Using a humidity/temperature report as an example, let's see how this is done. On the server side. After data is retrieved from the DHT sensor, a report message is created using the following format: // byte 0 = packet length // byte 1 = report type // byte 2 = report sub type - DHT_DATA or DHT_ERROR // byte 3 = pin number // byte 4 = dht type // byte 5 = humidity positivity flag 0=positive, 1= negative // byte 6 = temperature positivity flag 0=positive, 1= negative // byte 7 = humidity integer portion // byte 8 = humidity fractional portion // byte 9 = temperature integer portion // byte 10= temperature fractional portion Although both temperature and humidity values are reported as floating-point values that are 4 bytes in length each, we can use a \"trick\" to send these values using 3 bytes each. We can do this because the integer portion, the value on the left side of the decimal point, and the fractional portion, the value on the right side of the decimal, are valued at less than 256. As a result, we can send the integer and fractional portions as bytes. However, we do still need to be able to differentiate between positive and negative values. The value's positivity is checked, and a flag is set to indicate if the value is positive or negative. As a result, a floating point value is represented in three bytes instead of four, making the data packet more efficient for transmission across the link. Using humidity as an example, here is the code that performs this conversion: float j, f; float humidity = dhts[i].dht_sensor->getHumidity(); if (humidity >= 0.0) { report_message[5] = 0; } else { report_message[5] = 1; } f = modff(humidity, &j); report_message[7] = (uint8_t)j; report_message[8] = (uint8_t)(f * 100); The humidity is retrieved by calling the DHTStable library method, getHumdity . The humidity's positivity is checked, and the positivity flag is appropriately set within the report message. Then using the C library function modff , the integer portion of the value is separated from the fractional part. The integer portion is returned in \"j,\" and the fractional part is returned in \"f.\" The fractional part is multiplied by 100 to convert the value to an integer. On the client side, the converted bytes need to be reassembled into floats before providing the data values to the user application. f_humidity = float(data[5] + data[6] / 100) if data[3]: f_humidity *= -1.0 Here, we retrieve the integer and fractional portions from the report message. The fractional part is divided by 100 to return it to a floating-point value, and then the integer and fractional values are added together. Lastly, the positivity flag is checked to determine if the value is positive or negative and adjusted appropriately. Copyright (C) 2020-21 Alan Yorinks.

Some data types, such as integers and floating-point values, are larger than a single byte. For the Telemetrix Project, an integer value is two bytes in length, and a floating-point value is four bytes in size. The multi-byte values are disassembled into individual bytes before transmission when sending a value larger than a byte in length. When received, the individual bytes are reassembled into the original multi-byte value. For all data items that must be represented in this manner, by convention, the most significant byte (MSB) is the first byte transmitted, followed by all subsequent bytes in descending byte order. For example, the DHT 22 sensor expresses temperature and humidity values as floating-point. To send a report containing these values to the client, they must first be converted to individual bytes. Using a humidity/temperature report as an example, let's see how this is done. On the server side. After data is retrieved from the DHT sensor, a report message is created using the following format: // byte 0 = packet length // byte 1 = report type // byte 2 = report sub type - DHT_DATA or DHT_ERROR // byte 3 = pin number // byte 4 = dht type // byte 5 = humidity positivity flag 0=positive, 1= negative // byte 6 = temperature positivity flag 0=positive, 1= negative // byte 7 = humidity integer portion // byte 8 = humidity fractional portion // byte 9 = temperature integer portion // byte 10= temperature fractional portion Although both temperature and humidity values are reported as floating-point values that are 4 bytes in length each, we can use a \"trick\" to send these values using 3 bytes each. We can do this because the integer portion, the value on the left side of the decimal point, and the fractional portion, the value on the right side of the decimal, are valued at less than 256. As a result, we can send the integer and fractional portions as bytes. However, we do still need to be able to differentiate between positive and negative values. The value's positivity is checked, and a flag is set to indicate if the value is positive or negative. As a result, a floating point value is represented in three bytes instead of four, making the data packet more efficient for transmission across the link. Using humidity as an example, here is the code that performs this conversion: float j, f; float humidity = dhts[i].dht_sensor->getHumidity(); if (humidity >= 0.0) { report_message[5] = 0; } else { report_message[5] = 1; } f = modff(humidity, &j); report_message[7] = (uint8_t)j; report_message[8] = (uint8_t)(f * 100); The humidity is retrieved by calling the DHTStable library method, getHumdity . The humidity's positivity is checked, and the positivity flag is appropriately set within the report message. Then using the C library function modff , the integer portion of the value is separated from the fractional part. The integer portion is returned in \"j,\" and the fractional part is returned in \"f.\" The fractional part is multiplied by 100 to convert the value to an integer. On the client side, the converted bytes need to be reassembled into floats before providing the data values to the user application. f_humidity = float(data[5] + data[6] / 100) if data[3]: f_humidity *= -1.0 Here, we retrieve the integer and fractional portions from the report message. The fractional part is divided by 100 to return it to a floating-point value, and then the integer and fractional values are added together. Lastly, the positivity flag is checked to determine if the value is positive or negative and adjusted appropriately. Copyright (C) 2020-21 Alan Yorinks.

Preamble The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software. The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things. Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public. The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version. An older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Definitions. \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License. \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks. \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations. To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work. A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program. To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well. To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying. An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion. Source Code. The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work. A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language. The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it. The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work. Basic Permissions. All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you. Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law. No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures. When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures. Conveying Verbatim Copies. You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee. Conveying Modified Source Versions. You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date. b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\". c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it. d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so. A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate. Conveying Non-Source Forms. You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways: a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange. b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge. c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b. d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements. e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d. A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work. A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product. \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made. If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM). The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network. Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying. Additional Terms. \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions. When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms: a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors. All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying. If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms. Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way. Termination. You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11). However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies. You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients. Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts. You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it. Patents. A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\". A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License. Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version. In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party. If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid. If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it. A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007. Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law. No Surrender of Others' Freedom. If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the GNU General Public License. Revised Versions of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General Public License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program. Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version. Disclaimer of Warranty. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16. If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Affero General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>. Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its interface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the specific requirements. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.

Upload Telemetrix4Esp8266 to your Arduino-Core board by selecting File/Examples/Telemetrix4Esp8266/Telemetrix4Esp8266. 6. Edit the sketch values for SSID and PASSWORD to match the values of your network so that the network may assign an IP address to your ESP-8266 7. Connect a USB serial cable to your ESP-8266 device and upload the modified Telemetrix4Esp8266 sketch to your device by clicking the Upload button on the Arduino IDE. 8. To determine the IP address your router assigned to the device, open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor, and set the baud rate to 115200. Reset the ESP-8266. If you are using a NodeMCU type device, press the RST button. The onboard LED will light, and you should see a message on the serial monitor that the board is connecting to your network. Upon successful connection, the onboard LED will be extinguished, and the IP address and port are displayed on the serial monitor. NOTE: If you are using multiple ESP-8266 devices for your application, you may set the port value to be used by modifying the default value in the sketch. Make a note of the IP address and port number reported. These will be used when instantiating your Telemetrix Python application. You may see some \"garbage\" characters appear in the serial monitor resulting from the reset and generated by the ESP-8266. Ignore those characters. ![](./images/esp_8266_connect.png) 9.
